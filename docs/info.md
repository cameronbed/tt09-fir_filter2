## How it works

The Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter handles input that comes in short bursts. The output is filtered by an accumulating factor. Each input is added back to the factor so that the next output filtering is influenced by the previous input. This unconfitional feedback loop prevents bursts of noise from affecting the longterm output.
